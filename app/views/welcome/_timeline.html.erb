                            One of our clients is a leading software startup building in downtown San Francisco that approached us to make their large office space more comfortable for their ~80 occupants â€”and more efficient for their bottom line. 
                            <br/>
                            <br/>Our team did a detailed analysis of the leased property and concluded that they could save $12,000 per year in energy costs and that the building owner could implement a hardware upgrade for no cost due to rebates and other incentives. 
                            <br/>
                            <br/>Bay Efficiency completed a retrofit of light bulbs, thermostats and select HVAC components and had reduced monthly expenses by almost $1,000.
