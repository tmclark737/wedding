                        Tracy wasn’t planning to pick up the phone, and when the phone rang she was standing in her kitchen talking to her roommate, Bev.  Tracy picked up the phone, “Hello.”<br>
                        <br>
                        They talked about the weather; Ty likes cloudy days, Tracy likes sunny days.  They talked about San Francisco, restaurants, current happenings, and in the end, after a couple of long phone calls they agreed to go on a date.<br>
                        <br>
                        Tracy and Ty met up for their first date. They took a long, meandering walk that started in the Financial District, went through Chinatown, and ended in North Beach. <br>
                        <br>
                        They decided on Sotto Mare, a little family-run Italian restaurant in North Beach for dinner and dined on penne arrabiata and sand dabs.  Delicious food followed delicious laughter, and hilarious stories made for a memorable first date, e.g., when Ty though he was getting fired from EMCOR but end up getting a promotion.<br>
                        <br>
                        Tracy particularly enjoys the bit where Ty tries to sell her his band, The Ephemerals’, album on iTunes.<br>
